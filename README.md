# React + Vite
Title: Counter Value App with React and Vite

Description: A simple and interactive counter application built using React with Vite as the build tool. The app allows users to increment and decrement a numeric counter value. This project demonstrates the fundamentals of React components, state management using useState, and a fast development environment provided by Vite.

Key Features:

Increment and Decrement: Buttons to increase or decrease the counter value.
Dynamic Rendering: Real-time updates of the counter value on user interaction.
State Management: Utilizes the useState hook for state handling.
Lightweight and Fast: Vite ensures quick startup and build times.
Technology Stack:

Frontend: React
Build Tool: Vite
Styling: (Optional) CSS or a styling library like Tailwind or Bootstrap.
Usage:

Increment Button: Increases the counter value by 1.
Decrement Button: Decreases the counter value by 1.
Reset Functionality (Optional): Resets the counter value to its initial state.
Project Setup Steps:

Initialize the project using Vite.
Install React and ReactDOM.
Set up the App component with a useState hook for the counter value.
Add UI buttons and their corresponding event handlers.
Style the application for a clean and responsive look.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
